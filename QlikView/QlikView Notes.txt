Part 2 - 

- What is QVD
	Qlikview data file format. It stores simple table into QVD. Because of this it fetches data faster. Backup. For improving incremental load(means fetching only newly added data and adding it to existing side). 

	STORE Table1 into MYFIRSTQVD.QVD(QVD);	--(We can also  specify path vefore QVD file name, else it will be stored in the location where qwd is present.)
	
	STORE Table1 into MYFIRSTQVD.csv(txt);
	
- QVD must scenario
- Export data to CSV
- QVD related function

If we specify name of QVD file in Qlikview, we can fetch meta data from QVD.
- LET vQVDTIME = QvdCreateTime('QVDFilename.QVD');	-> Reload button		(QVD creation time)
	Right clik -> New sheet objects -> Text Objects -> In Text enter variable name =vQVDTIME -> Apply

- LET vQVDNoofrec = QvdNoOfRecords('QVDFilename.QVD');
	Right clik -> New sheet objects -> Text Objects -> In Text enter variable name =vQVDNoofrec -> Apply
 
- LET vQVDNoofField = QvdNoOfRecords('QVDFilename.QVD');

4. Importing Data from Excel into QlikView - 

File -> new (will open new document) -> (You can cancel the wizard) -> Save document(.qvw) -> go to script editor (using icon in toolbar) or ctrl + E -> To import goto data tab ->
we can connect to a db or load data from flat files(by clicking Table Files buttons) other options are also there -> Select excel file -> Select file type -> 
Select Tables (excel sheets names are present related to workbook) -> Header size (none - header is on first lines, for header is present on some other line in excel specify 
that line number) -> Embedded labels -> Removing the columns press cross button -> Finish 

QlikView generates the script. 

Prior to LOAD keyword we can give a name to table or data we imported. 

Whenever we are importing data from flat files we show check the relative path checkbox. Helpful when we need to deploy QlikView file on the server.

Clik relative path -> follow same steps to load data from excel -> In the script Directory keyword is there, you can change it to any table name. 

We can change column name also. eg - [Call Number] As CallNo. (If we want space the surrond them with brackets. [Call No])
