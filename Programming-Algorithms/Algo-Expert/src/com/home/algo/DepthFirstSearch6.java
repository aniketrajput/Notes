/*
 * Depth-first Search
 * 
 * You are given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children Nodes. When put together, Nodes form a simple tree-like structure. 
 * Implement the depthFirstSearch method on the Node class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tress using the Depth-first Search approach 
 * (specifically navigating the tree from left to right), stores all the Nodes' names in the input array, and return it.
 * 
 * Sample input:
 * 
 * 				 A
 * 			   / | \
 * 			  B  C  D	
 * 			 / \   / \	
 *			E   F  G  H 
 *			   / \  \
 *			  I   J  K
 *
 *	Sample Output: ["A", "B", "E", "F", "I", "J", "C", "D", "G", "K", "H"]
 *
