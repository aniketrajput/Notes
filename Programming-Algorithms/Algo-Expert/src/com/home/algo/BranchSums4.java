/*
 We need to find the sum of each branch (starting from root node going till the leaf node)
 
 So if we have 5 leaf nodes we will have 5 branches/path and 5 sums of each branch.
 
 We need to return the sums in an array.
 
 			     1
 			  /    \ 
 			 2	    3
 			/ \    / \
 		   4   5  6   7
          / \   \
 		 8	 9  10
 		 
 Output: [15, 16, 18, 10. 11]
